## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the MealConnect project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
* [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (v5 or higher)
* `npm` or `yarn` package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/mealconnect.git](https://github.com/your-username/mealconnect.git)
    cd mealconnect
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**
    ```bash
    # Install backend dependencies
    npm install
    # Assuming a 'client' folder for the React app
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
    ```env
    # MongoDB connection string
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mealconnect

    # JWT secret for authentication
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_12345

    # (Optional) Cloudinary for image uploads
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

    # (Optional) Mapbox or other service for location/mapping
    MAPBOX_API_KEY=your_mapbox_api_key
    ```

4.  **Start the development servers:**
    ```bash
    # Start the backend server (from the root directory)
    npm run dev
    
    # Start the frontend development server (from the 'client' directory)
    cd client
    npm start
    ```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and `http://localhost:5000` (backend API).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:**
    * **React:** For building the user interface.
    * **React Router:** For client-side routing.
    * **React Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc., for state and logic management.
    * **Axios:** For making API requests.
    * **Mapping Library:** (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox) for location-based features.
    * **UI Framework:** (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Bootstrap) for styling.

* **Backend:**
    * **Node.js & Express:** For the server-side API.
    * **MongoDB:** The NoSQL database for data storage.
    * **Mongoose:** ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB to define schemas.
    * **Passport.js / JWT:** For user authentication and authorization.
    * **Bcrypt:** For password hashing.
    * **Multer / Cloudinary:** For handling file uploads (e.g., food images).
